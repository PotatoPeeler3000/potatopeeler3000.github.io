The Projects section features software engineering work Nick has pursued outside of his professional roles.
In his free time, he enjoys exploring new technologies, building tools, and experimenting with ideas that deepen his skills and fuel his passion for software development.
The following goes through these differnet works.

<h2>Speech to Text Assistant</h2>

<p>This project created a helpful tool that lets you control your computer with your voice. You can ask it about the weather, open apps on your computer, or send emails through Outlook—just by speaking. 
It's great for saving time or for people who prefer to use their voice instead of typing or clicking. 
This assistant was made using Python and open-source tools. 
It uses libraries like SpeechRecognition and pyaudio to understand what you say. 
For weather updates, it connects to an online weather service. 
To send emails, it works with Outlook using a tool called pywin32. 
Because it's built with free and open tools, it's easy to change or improve later.</p>

<p>A simple graphical user interface (GUI) was also created using Tkinter. 
This lets users click buttons to do the same tasks, like getting the weather or sending an email. 
There are also text input fields where users can type in a city name to check the weather or fill in email details like the recipient, subject, and message. 
This makes the assistant easy to use for both voice and manual input.</p>

<h2>Creating Music Videos</h2>

<p>I also explored multimedia creation by making music videos using Adobe Premiere Pro and Kdenlive, a free and open-source video editor.
These projects involved compiling photos from vacations and moments with friends, then syncing them with background music to create engaging and personal video memories.
Using Premiere Pro, I took advantage of advanced editing features like keyframe animation, audio transitions, and color correction to give the videos a polished, professional feel.
With Kdenlive, I was able to perform similar tasks on systems where I preferred a lighter, open-source toolchain. It allowed me to cut, arrange, and add effects to clips easily while keeping the workflow smooth and flexible.</p>
  
<p>These music videos were not only a creative outlet but also helped me develop video editing skills, gain familiarity with timeline-based editors, and understand how to structure visual narratives effectively.
Whether it's syncing a photo slideshow to beats or adding transitions to match music tempo, these tools offered a powerful way to tell stories through visuals and sound.</p>

<h2>Tinkering in the Terminal</h2>

<p>I enjoy spending time in the terminal, exploring new commands and understanding how different tools work under the hood.
Whether it's customizing my shell with aliases and functions or learning useful networking commands, I find the command line to be a powerful and satisfying way to interact with my computer.
For example, I've used watch -n 0.5 nvidia-smi to monitor GPU usage in real time, and explored commands like ip route show to check network routing paths and ip a to view my IP addresses.
I like these commands because they're short and simple, yet they give you quick, clear results—perfect for checking system or network status without any hassle.</p>

<p>To take my skills further, I've been working through Bandit, one of the beginner-friendly games on the OverTheWire platform.
Bandit is designed to teach foundational command line skills through a series of progressively challenging levels.
Each level requires problem-solving and creative use of commands to find passwords hidden in files, processes, or obscure system behaviors.
Playing Bandit has been a fun and practical way to sharpen my terminal knowledge while learning new tricks I might not encounter in everyday use.</p>
