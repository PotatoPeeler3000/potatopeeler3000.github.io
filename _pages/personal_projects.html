<h2>Speech to Text Assistant</h2>

<p>This project created a helpful tool that lets you control your computer with your voice. You can ask it about the weather, open apps on your computer, or send emails through Outlookâ€”just by speaking. 
It's great for saving time or for people who prefer to use their voice instead of typing or clicking. 
This assistant was made using Python and open-source tools. 
It uses libraries like SpeechRecognition and pyaudio to understand what you say. 
For weather updates, it connects to an online weather service. 
To send emails, it works with Outlook using a tool called pywin32. 
Because it's built with free and open tools, it's easy to change or improve later.</p>

<p>A simple graphical user interface (GUI) was also created using Tkinter. 
This lets users click buttons to do the same tasks, like getting the weather or sending an email. 
There are also text input fields where users can type in a city name to check the weather or fill in email details like the recipient, subject, and message. 
This makes the assistant easy to use for both voice and manual input.</p>
