I’ve always loved learning—there’s something incredibly exciting about uncovering new ideas and pushing myself to understand things more deeply. As a software engineer, that curiosity drives me every day. I’m constantly looking for ways to improve my skills, whether it’s picking up a new programming language, experimenting with emerging technologies, or refining my approach to problem-solving. I don’t just want to write code that works—I want to write code that’s clean, efficient, and elegant. Every challenge is an opportunity to grow, and I see each step forward as part of a lifelong journey to become the best engineer I can be.

**Career Interests**

I’m especially fascinated by the intersection of machine learning and robotics, and I love the challenge of making systems that can not only learn from data but also interact with the real world. The idea of teaching a robot to adapt, make decisions, and respond to its environment is incredibly exciting to me. I enjoy diving into topics like computer vision, reinforcement learning, and control systems, always curious about how they can come together to create smarter, more capable machines.

Outside of building and experimenting, I dedicate a lot of time to self-improvement. Whether it’s reading research papers, watching technical talks, or taking online courses, I’m constantly pushing myself to grow. I believe that being a great engineer means never getting too comfortable—there’s always something new to learn, a better way to solve a problem, or a deeper understanding to gain. For me, that journey of continuous learning is what makes this field so rewarding.
